The complete code will be upload when our patent and manuscript is accepted.
The original code is written using C and matlab,for simiplicity, we transform it into matlab, it can be used successfully in out toy example, you can find these result in our manuscript.
If you find some problems, please contanct shliu@pku.edu.cn or dingcaiying@tyut.edu.cn

Thansk for the Editor and those reviews (Neurocomputing), we have make many modifications of our manuscript. Our code is also re-run to obtain more results to support our manuscript.
For conveninently, we update our code. In this version, we encapsulate it as an executable interface program with GUI. You can check the result with this code. Enjoy!
